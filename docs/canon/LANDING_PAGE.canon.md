# LANDING_PAGE.canon.md
Version: 1.0  
Status: CANON — LOCKED  
Project: Firsttimecontractor  
Scope: Public Landing Page, Under-Construction Messaging, First-Contact Positioning

---

## 1. Purpose

Define the canonical purpose, tone, and content of the **public landing page**, including
“under construction” states, so that:

- first-time visitors understand what Firsttimecontractor is
- expectations are set accurately and calmly
- the product is not misrepresented as a school or certification
- temporary states do not drift into ad-hoc messaging
- future edits remain aligned with architecture and intent

The landing page is **truth-setting**, not sales-driven.

---

## 2. Core Principle (Non-Negotiable)

> **The landing page explains what the tool is and is not — without persuasion, urgency, or hype.**

The landing page does not attempt to:
- convert aggressively
- promise outcomes
- replace formal education
- act as a marketing funnel

---

## 3. Canonical Positioning Copy (LOCKED)

The following text is the **authoritative positioning statement** and MUST NOT be rewritten
without explicit re-ratification:

> **Firsttimecontractor is a practical learning and reference tool for people entering or working in the trades.**  
>  
> It is not a contractor school and does not replace required education.  
>  
> Instead, it’s designed to be used alongside classes and after they’re finished — when rules need to be understood, interpreted, and applied in real situations.  
>  
> Schools prepare you to pass exams.  
>  
> **Firsttimecontractor exists to help the rules make sense when you’re studying, working, and learning on the job.**

This copy may be visually styled but not semantically altered.

## 4. Under-Construction Messaging Rules

When the product is incomplete or actively being built, the landing page MAY display a
clear “under construction” notice.

### Allowed framing
- Calm
- Honest
- Non-apologetic
- Informational

### Example (non-binding)
> “This tool is actively being built. Some sections may be incomplete.”

### Forbidden framing
❌ Apologies  
❌ Urgency (“sign up now”, “limited access”)  
❌ Roadmap promises  
❌ Feature lists implying completeness  

---

## 5. What the Landing Page MUST Communicate

At minimum, the landing page MUST make clear:

- This is a **tool**, not a school
- It complements education; it does not replace it
- It focuses on understanding and application
- It is safe to explore without commitment

---

## 6. What the Landing Page MUST NOT Do

The landing page MUST NOT:

❌ Claim exam pass guarantees  
❌ Imply certification or licensing authority  
❌ Mimic trade schools or prep courses  
❌ Contain growth funnels or upsell pressure  
❌ Expose internal architecture or admin concepts

## 7. Relationship to Other Canon

This document works in conjunction with:

- PRODUCT_POSITIONING.canon.md
- ONBOARDING_TONE.canon.md
- DEMO_MODE.canon.md
- ARCHITECTURE.canon.md

If conflict exists, **this document governs first-contact user understanding**.

---

## 8. Canon Lock Statement

Any change that:
- reframes the product as a school,
- adds persuasive marketing language,
- or weakens expectation clarity

is CANON-breaking and requires explicit re-ratification.

END OF CANON
