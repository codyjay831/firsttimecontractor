# CONTENT_WRITING_RULES.canon.md
Version: 1.0  
Status: CANON — LOCKED  
Project: Firsttimecontractor  
Applies To: Questions, Explanations, Flashcards, Guided Practice, Exam Review

---

## 1. Purpose

Define canonical writing rules for all educational content so that:

- Content is authoritative (exam-safe)
- Content is human-readable (teachable)
- Interpretive areas of code and law are explained clearly
- Users understand not just *what is correct*, but *why it is correct*

This canon exists because:
- Codes are interpreted
- Laws are interpreted
- Inspectors and boards apply judgment
- Pure textbook language alone is insufficient for learning

---

## 2. Core Writing Philosophy (Non-Negotiable)

> **Every explanation must contain BOTH:**
> 1. A textbook / authoritative explanation  
> 2. A human / intuitive explanation  

Neither may replace the other.

---

## 3. Canonical Explanation Structure

Each Question explanation MUST follow this structure:

### 3.1 Textbook Rule (Authoritative Layer)

**Purpose:**  
State the rule as it would appear in:
- a code book
- an exam reference
- a licensing authority explanation

**Requirements:**
- Formal tone
- Precise language
- No metaphors
- No personal opinion
- No “usually” or “kind of”
- Must stand alone as exam justification

**Example pattern:**
> “Under NEC 250.24(A)(5), the grounded conductor shall not be connected to normally non–current-carrying metal parts on the load side of the service disconnecting means.”

---

### 3.2 Human Interpretation (Intuition Layer)

**Purpose:**  
Explain how humans actually reason about this rule in the real world.

This section answers:
- *What problem is this rule preventing?*
- *Why does this feel weird at first?*
- *What mistake do people commonly make?*

**Requirements:**
- Plain language
- Short paragraphs
- Real-world framing
- No slang, but conversational
- May use examples or analogies

**Example pattern:**
> “In simple terms, once you pass the main disconnect, neutral and ground must stay separate. If they are bonded again downstream, return current can travel on metal parts, which is exactly what grounding is meant to prevent.”

---

### 3.3 (Optional) Practical Example or Scenario

**Purpose:**  
Anchor the rule in a situation the learner can picture.

**Allowed formats:**
- Jobsite example
- Inspector perspective
- “What goes wrong if you do this”
- Mini scenario

**Rules:**
- Optional but recommended
- Must reinforce the textbook rule
- Must not introduce exceptions unless explicitly stated

---

## 4. Single Canonical Explanation Rule

- Each Question has **one canonical explanation**
- That explanation includes both layers above
- UI may reveal parts progressively, but content remains singular

---

## 5. Correct vs Incorrect Feedback (UI, not content)

Writers MUST NOT create separate explanations for:
- correct answers
- incorrect answers

Instead:
- The explanation is always the same
- UI MAY prepend one short sentence:

Examples:
- “You selected the correct answer because…”
- “This choice is incorrect because it violates the rule above…”

These are **presentation concerns**, not content concerns.

---

## 6. Tone and Authority Rules

### Required
- Calm
- Confident
- Neutral
- Non-judgmental

### Forbidden
❌ Sarcasm  
❌ “Gotcha” tone  
❌ Shaming language  
❌ “Trick question” framing  
❌ Overly casual slang  

This is **first-time contractor**, not gatekeeping.

---

## 7. Handling Ambiguity and Interpretation

When rules are commonly interpreted differently:

### Allowed
- Explicitly state:  
  > “This is how exams and inspectors generally interpret this rule.”
- Clarify scope:  
  > “While local AHJs may vary, licensing exams expect…”

### Forbidden
❌ “It depends” without explanation  
❌ Presenting edge cases without framing  
❌ Undermining the authority of the rule  

---

## 8. Exam Alignment Rule

When there is tension between:
- perfect real-world nuance  
- exam expectations  

**The exam expectation wins**, with a note explaining real-world nuance if needed.

---

## 9. Flashcards vs Practice vs Exam Review

The SAME explanation content is used everywhere.

Differences are UI-driven:
- Flashcards may collapse sections
- Guided practice may reveal step-by-step
- Exam review may show all at once

Content must be written to support all three.

---

## 10. Anti-Patterns (Explicitly Forbidden)

❌ Pure textbook quotes with no explanation  
❌ Pure “story” explanations with no formal rule  
❌ Multiple competing explanations per question  
❌ Explaining only why wrong answers are wrong  
❌ Adding exceptions without stating scope  

---

## 11. Canon Lock Statement

This writing model is foundational.

Any change that:
- removes either the textbook or human layer
- introduces multiple explanations per question
- relies on UI to “fix” unclear writing

is CANON-breaking and requires explicit re-ratification.
