# Refund Handling — Internal Support Guide

Audience: Internal / Support Only
Status: Approved Policy

---

## Philosophy

Refunds are **not adversarial**.

If someone requests a refund, we assume good intent.

The product is already generous and affordable. Trust is more valuable than a single payment.

---

## Standard Refund Policy (Pro)

* Refund window: **14 days from purchase**
* No usage thresholds
* No activity review required
* Refunds are **always approved**

There are **no denied refunds**.

---

## What Happens After a Refund

* User keeps access to all free study tools
* Any progress or insights already generated remain visible
* Pro features deactivate automatically

Do **not** remove study history or penalize the user.

---

## Abuse Handling (Silent)

We do **not** accuse users of abuse.

Internal soft rule:

* One refund per exam eligibility window

If a user requests a second refund:

* Approve it
* Flag internally
* Do not message the user differently

Trust > enforcement.

## Support Macros

### Refund Approved

> Your refund has been processed. You’ll continue to have full access to all free study tools, and any progress you’ve made is still available. Let us know if there’s anything we can improve.

### Refund Confirmation (Short)

> We’ve issued your refund. Thanks for giving Pro a try.

### Reactivation (If Asked)

> You can re-enable Pro anytime if the planning tools would be helpful again. There’s no penalty or restriction.

## Language Rules

Never say:

* "You didn’t complete enough study"
* "We can’t refund because…"
* "This is a one-time exception"

Never imply fault.

If you feel unsure, default to approving the refund.
