## Core Principle

Passing the exam must **never** depend on payment.

All study content, difficulty levels, and exam simulations are available in the free tier.

Monetization may only improve **structure, continuity, and guidance** — never knowledge access or advantage.

---

## Tier Definitions

Includes:

* Full question bank

* Unlimited attempts

Rationale:

* Exam requirements change
* Content packs evolve

---
