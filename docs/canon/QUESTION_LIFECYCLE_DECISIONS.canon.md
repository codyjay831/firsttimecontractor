# QUESTION_LIFECYCLE_DECISIONS.canon.md
Version: 1.0  
Status: CANON — LOCKED  
Project: Firsttimecontractor  
Scope: Question Correction, Clarification, Retirement Decisions

---

## 1. Purpose

Define clear rules for deciding whether a question should be:
- clarified
- updated
- or retired

So that content quality improves without churn.

---

## 2. Clarify (Preferred First Response)

A question SHOULD be **clarified**, not retired, if:

✅ The rule is correct  
✅ The answer is correct  
✅ The explanation is confusing or incomplete  
✅ Users misunderstand interpretation  
✅ The wording causes ambiguity  

**Action**
- Update explanation (Textbook or Human section)
- Increment version
- Keep question active

---

## 3. Update (Answer Change)

A question SHOULD be **updated** if:

✅ The rule has changed  
✅ The answer is outdated  
✅ The exam expectation has shifted  
✅ The correct choice is wrong  

**Action**
- Update answer + explanation
- Increment version
- Keep question active if still relevant

---

## 4. Retire (Last Resort)

A question MUST be **retired** if:

❌ The rule is no longer valid  
❌ The concept is no longer tested  
❌ The question is inherently misleading  
❌ The law has been repealed or restructured  
❌ The question cannot be fixed without rewriting entirely  

**Action**
- Retire question
- Do NOT delete
- Preserve history

---

## 5. State-Specific Retirement Rule

Retirement applies **only to the affected state**.

No cross-state retirement is allowed.

---

## 6. Anti-Patterns (Forbidden)

❌ Retiring questions due to disagreement alone  
❌ Retiring instead of clarifying  
❌ Leaving broken questions active “for later”  
❌ Silent edits without version increment  

---

## 7. Canon Lock Statement

Any change that:
- retires questions prematurely,
- avoids clarification when appropriate,
- or propagates retirements across states

is CANON-breaking and requires explicit re-ratification.

---

END OF CANON
