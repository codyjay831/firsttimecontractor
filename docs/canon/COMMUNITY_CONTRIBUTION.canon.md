# COMMUNITY_CONTRIBUTION.canon.md
Version: 1.0  
Status: CANON — LOCKED  
Project: Firsttimecontractor  
Scope: User Contributions, Feedback, Non-Authoritative Input

---

## 1. Purpose

Define a safe, structured way for users to help improve content without granting authority or creating public debate.

Community contribution exists to:
- surface errors and outdated rules
- suggest clarifications
- share official sources
- improve accuracy over time

---

## 2. Core Principle (Non-Negotiable)

> **Community input is signal, not authority.**

Users may contribute information, but never edit, approve, or override content.

---

## 3. Allowed Contribution Types

Users MAY:
- Report incorrect or outdated content
- Suggest clearer wording
- Share official sources (links + notes)
- Flag ambiguity or confusion
- Opt-in to help review content for their state

Users MAY NOT:
❌ Edit questions  
❌ Change answers  
❌ Approve updates  
❌ See other users’ reports  
❌ Influence other states  

---

## 4. Entry Points

### 4.1 Per-Question
- **Flag question** (footer tool)

### 4.2 Global (Optional)
- **Want to help improve Firsttimecontractor?** (static page or footer link)

---

## 5. Contribution Intake Rules

Each contribution MUST be:
- tied to a specific Question ID
- tied to a specific State (if applicable)
- non-public
- non-binding

All contributions are reviewed internally.

---

## 6. Tone & Messaging (User-Facing)

Allowed copy:
> “Thanks for helping keep content accurate. Reports are reviewed per state.”

Forbidden:
❌ Promises of fixes  
❌ Timelines  
❌ Public acknowledgements  

---

## 7. Abuse & Noise Control

- Repeated low-quality submissions may be rate-limited
- No public comment threads
- No voting or ranking of reports

---

## 8. Canon Lock Statement

Any change that:
- grants users editing authority,
- introduces public debates,
- or allows cross-state influence

is CANON-breaking and requires explicit re-ratification.
