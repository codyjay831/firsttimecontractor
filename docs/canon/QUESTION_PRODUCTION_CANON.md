# Question Production Canon v1.0

**Project:** FirstTimeContractor (FTC)

**Purpose:**
Define strict, enforceable rules for how exam‑style questions are written, reviewed, and approved so that every question:

* makes sense on first read
* matches real contractor exam thinking (CSLB‑style)
* teaches correct mental models
* never relies on trick wording, ambiguity, or lazy abstractions

This canon exists because *badly written questions damage trust more than wrong answers*.

---

## 1. Core Principle (Non‑Negotiable)

> **If a user has to reinterpret the question, the question is wrong.**

Questions must be immediately understandable **without re‑framing**, guessing intent, or mentally correcting grammar.

---

## 2. Question–Answer Alignment Rule

**The grammatical form of the question must match the form of the answers.**

### Allowed alignments

* **Location question → location answers**

  * “Which drawing shows…” → floor plan / structural plan / detail sheet
* **Classification question → categories**

  * “Which type of wall…” → exterior / interior / load‑bearing
* **Action question → actions**

  * “What should the contractor do…” → notify AHJ / revise plans / stop work
* **Definition question → definitions**

### Forbidden alignment (hard fail)

* Asking **where** and answering with **what**
* Asking **what** and answering with **why**
* Asking **how** and answering with **when**

**Example (FAIL):**

> Where on a set of plans would you find bearing walls?
> – exterior walls
> – partition walls

(Category answers to a location question = invalid.)

---

## 3. Language Precision Standard

### Required

* Plain, professional trade language
* Terminology consistent with code books and CSLB tone
* One clear interpretation

### Forbidden

* Casual phrasing ("super extra load", "kind of", "basically")
* Vague fillers ("typically", "usually") unless the exam itself uses them
* Artificial exam‑sounding fluff

**Rule:**

> If the phrase would sound wrong on a plan review or jobsite, it does not belong in a question.

---

## 4. No Trick Question Rule

FTC questions **do not test cleverness**.

We do **not**:

* rely on semantic traps
* hide meaning in grammar
* reward guessing patterns ("any of these", "all of the above")

If multiple answers *could* be true, the question must be rewritten.

---

## 5. “Any / All of the Above” Policy

Allowed **only if**:

* each option is independently correct
* the question explicitly asks for a combined condition
* removing one option would make the answer wrong

Otherwise: **rewrite the question**.

Default stance: **avoid entirely**.

---

## 6. Real‑Exam Fidelity Rule

Questions must mirror how real contractor exams test knowledge:

They should test:

* identification
* application
* recognition of correct practice
* understanding of cause → effect

They should **not** test:

* trivia phrasing
* obscure edge wording
* academic theory divorced from job reality

---

## 7. Cognitive Load Rule

A question should require **thinking about the subject**, not decoding the sentence.

If the user’s effort is spent on:

* parsing grammar
* guessing intent
* rereading the stem

The question fails.

---

## 8. Explanation Requirement

Every question must include an explanation that:

* reinforces the correct concept
* explains *why* the wrong answers are wrong
* does not introduce new ambiguity

Explanations may teach **slightly beyond** the question, but never contradict it.

---

## 9. Question Review Checklist (Gate)

A question **cannot ship** unless all are true:

* [ ] Understood on first read
* [ ] Question grammar matches answers
* [ ] No slang or casual phrasing
* [ ] No trick logic
* [ ] Only one defensible correct answer
* [ ] Matches real exam tone
* [ ] Explanation reinforces learning

If any box fails → rewrite, do not patch.

---

## 10. Canon Example

### ❌ Invalid Question

> Where on a set of plans would you find bearing walls?

Why it fails:

* asks for location
* answers are categories
* forces reinterpretation

### ✅ Canon‑Compliant Rewrite

> Which type of wall can be load‑bearing?

or

> Which drawing in a residential plan set is MOST useful for identifying bearing walls?

---

## 11. Final Authority Statement

> **Clarity beats cleverness.**
> **Accuracy beats volume.**
> **Trust beats SEO.**

This canon overrides speed, quantity, and external pressure.

If a question violates this document, it does not belong in FirstTimeContractor.
