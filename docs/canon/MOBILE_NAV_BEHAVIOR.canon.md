# MOBILE_NAV_BEHAVIOR.canon.md
Version: 1.0  
Status: CANON — LOCKED  
Project: Firsttimecontractor  
Scope: Mobile Sidebar Behavior, Collapse Defaults, Reading Focus

---

## 1. Purpose

Define mobile behavior for navigation so that:
- content remains readable
- navigation stays accessible
- the app feels tool-like, not cluttered

---

## 2. Defaults (LOCKED)

- Mobile: left nav is hidden by default
- Access via top-left hamburger icon
- Opening nav overlays content; closing returns to content

---

## 3. Focus Rules

When a QuestionCard is active:
- allow quick nav close
- do not force persistent side panels

---

## 4. Tooltip Rules

Collapsed nav on mobile must still provide:
- icon labels via tooltips or long-press hint
- no hidden meaning changes

---

## 5. Canon Lock Statement

Any change that:
- permanently consumes screen space on mobile,
- or requires multiple taps to return to content

is CANON-breaking.
