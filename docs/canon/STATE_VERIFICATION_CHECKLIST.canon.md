# STATE_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.canon.md
Version: 1.0  
Status: CANON — LOCKED  
Project: Firsttimecontractor  
Scope: Verification of State-Specific Business / Law Content

---

## 1. Purpose

Define a mandatory checklist for verifying **state-specific Business / Law questions** so that:
- accuracy is defensible
- updates are consistent
- verification effort is explicit
- assumptions are minimized

---

## 2. Core Rule (Non-Negotiable)

> **Every Business / Law question MUST be verified against state authority before publishing or updating.**

Verification is state-local and cannot be inferred from other states.

---

## 3. Required Verification Sources (At Least One)

At least ONE of the following MUST be consulted:

- State contractor licensing board
- State statute or administrative code
- Official exam bulletin or candidate guide
- State-published consumer protection rules

Secondary sources (blogs, forums, courses) are NOT sufficient on their own.

---

## 4. Verification Checklist (Required)

Before publishing or updating a question, confirm:

- [ ] State is explicitly identified
- [ ] Rule is currently in effect (not repealed)
- [ ] Rule aligns with exam expectations (not just real-world nuance)
- [ ] Timelines, limits, and penalties are correct
- [ ] Explanation clearly states interpretation for this state
- [ ] No assumptions based on other states
- [ ] Version increment applied (if meaning changed)

---

## 5. Ambiguity Handling

If the rule is commonly misunderstood or interpreted differently:

- The explanation MUST state how exams and authorities generally interpret it
- Do NOT include unresolved debate
- Do NOT hedge with “it depends” without explanation

---

## 6. Verification Record (Admin-Only)

Admin UI SHOULD allow storing (non-public):
- verification source name
- verification date
- optional note

This record is for internal confidence, not user display.

---

## 7. Canon Lock Statement

Any change that:
- skips verification,
- relies on cross-state assumptions,
- or publishes unverified legal content

is CANON-breaking and requires explicit re-ratification.

---

END OF CANON
