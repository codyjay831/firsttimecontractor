# ADMIN_VS_USER_NAV.canon.md
Version: 1.0  
Status: CANON — LOCKED  
Project: Firsttimecontractor  
Scope: Differences Between User Navigation and Admin Navigation

---

## 1. Purpose

Define the minimal, disciplined differences between user and admin navigation so that:
- admin tools remain powerful but simple
- user UI remains learning-focused
- navigation does not drift into complexity

---

## 2. Core Rule (Non-Negotiable)

> **Admin navigation may expand options, but must not change the core navigation model.**

Left nav remains collapsible and tool-like.

---

## 3. User Left Nav (LOCKED)

User left nav items are limited to:

- Practice
- Exam simulation
- Flashcards
- Review mistakes
- State rules

---

## 4. Admin Left Nav (LOCKED)

Admin left nav MUST include:

- Dashboard
- Questions
- Other Pools
- Lenses
- Imports
- Settings (future)

Admin left nav MUST NOT include user learning items.

---

## 5. Shared Behavior

Both user and admin nav:
- originate top-left
- support collapse/expand
- use icons + tooltips in collapsed mode
- preserve clean reading space

---

## 6. Canon Lock Statement

Any change that:
- merges admin tools into user nav,
- expands user nav into category sprawl,
- or changes the core nav model

is CANON-breaking.
