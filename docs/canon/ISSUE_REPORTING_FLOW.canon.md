# ISSUE_REPORTING_FLOW.canon.md
Version 1.0  
Status CANON — LOCKED  
Project Firsttimecontractor  
Scope User Feedback, Error Reporting, Content Corrections

---

## 1. Purpose

Define a lightweight issue-reporting flow so that
- users can report problems easily
- reports are actionable
- legal disagreements are handled calmly
- admin review stays focused and state-scoped

---

## 2. Entry Point (User UI)

Each QuestionCard MUST include
- Flag question (footer tool)

This is the only reporting entry point.

---

## 3. Report Modal (Minimal by Design)

When “Flag question” is selected, show a modal with

### Required Fields
- Issue type (select one)
  - Incorrect for this state
  - Outdated
  - Unclear explanation
  - Typo  formatting
- Optional comment (free text)

### Auto-attached (not editable by user)
- Question ID
- State
- License
- Mode (practice  exam  flashcard)
- Timestamp

---

## 4. User Feedback Acknowledgement

After submission, show

 “Thanks. Reports are reviewed per state and help keep content accurate.”

No follow-up promises. No timelines.

---

## 5. Admin Intake Rules

Each report is stored as
- state-scoped
- question-scoped
- non-public
- non-binding

Reports do NOT auto-trigger changes.

---

## 6. Canon Lock Statement

Any change that
- allows cross-state issue merging,
- creates public debates,
- or pressures immediate fixes

is CANON-breaking.

---

END OF CANON
