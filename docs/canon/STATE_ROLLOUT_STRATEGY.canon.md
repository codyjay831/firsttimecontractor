# STATE_ROLLOUT_STRATEGY.canon.md
Version: 1.0  
Status: CANON — LOCKED  
Project: Firsttimecontractor  
Scope: State Launch Order, Verification Strategy, Expansion Rules

---

## 1. Purpose

Define a deliberate, low-risk strategy for rolling out states so that:
- legal accuracy is prioritized
- verification effort is manageable
- early mistakes are contained
- expansion remains predictable

---

## 2. Core Principle (Non-Negotiable)

> **States are launched deliberately, verified independently, and expanded incrementally.**

No “nationwide” Business/Law launch is allowed.

---

## 3. Launch Tiers (LOCKED)

### Tier 1 — Anchor States
**Criteria**
- Large contractor population
- Well-documented statutes
- Clear exam bulletins
- High feedback volume potential

**Purpose**
- Establish baseline processes
- Stress-test verification, reporting, and updates

**Typical size**
- 1–3 states at launch

---

### Tier 2 — Expansion States
**Criteria**
- Similar structure to Tier 1
- Clear licensing authority
- Fewer edge cases

**Purpose**
- Validate repeatability
- Increase coverage safely

**Typical size**
- 3–7 additional states

---

### Tier 3 — Long-Tail States
**Criteria**
- Smaller populations
- Less documentation
- Unique legal quirks

**Purpose**
- Careful, slower rollout
- Heavier reliance on verification checklist

---

## 4. Per-State Launch Checklist (Required)

Before a state is marked **Active**:

- [ ] State verification checklist completed
- [ ] Business/Law questions created (state-only)
- [ ] Confidence levels set (New)
- [ ] Confidence banner enabled
- [ ] Issue reporting enabled
- [ ] Metrics tracking confirmed
- [ ] Admin audit logging active

---

## 5. Soft Launch Rule

New states SHOULD:
- launch quietly
- expect higher “New” content ratio
- prioritize review over growth

No announcements are required.

---

## 6. Feedback Window Rule

For the first review window after launch:
- Expect higher flag volume
- Prefer clarification over retirement
- Do not rush cross-question changes

---

## 7. Expansion Pace Rule

- Never launch more states than you can review
- Accuracy beats coverage
- Pausing rollout is allowed and encouraged

---

## 8. Canon Lock Statement

Any change that:
- launches states without verification,
- treats Business/Law as reusable across states,
- or prioritizes coverage over accuracy

is CANON-breaking and requires explicit re-ratification.
