# LEGAL_CONFIDENCE_BANNER.canon.md
Version: 1.0  
Status: CANON — LOCKED  
Project: Firsttimecontractor  
Scope: User-Facing Confidence Indicators for Business / Law Content

---

## 1. Purpose

Define when and how to display **confidence banners** so that:
- users understand scope and intent
- legal content is not misrepresented
- disagreements are defused calmly
- trust is built without disclaimers everywhere

---

## 2. Core Rule

> **Confidence banners clarify scope — they do not disclaim responsibility.**

Banners explain *what this content represents*, not what it avoids.

---

## 3. When a Confidence Banner MUST Appear

A confidence banner MUST be shown for:

- Business / Law questions
- State-specific legal content
- Exam-aligned legal interpretations

---

## 4. Canonical Banner Copy (LOCKED)

The banner MUST use calm, factual language.

**Allowed canonical copy:**
> “This reflects how this rule is commonly tested and enforced in **[State]**.”

No variants are allowed without re-ratification.

---

## 5. Placement Rules

- Banner appears above the explanation block
- Banner does NOT interrupt the question prompt
- Banner is subtle (informational, not alarming)

---

## 6. Forbidden Language

❌ “Not legal advice”  
❌ “Use at your own risk”  
❌ “This may be wrong”  
❌ Long disclaimers  

Confidence comes from clarity, not warnings.

---

## 7. Canon Lock Statement

Any change that:
- removes clarity banners from legal content,
- adds defensive disclaimers,
- or overuses banners outside legal scope

is CANON-breaking and requires explicit re-ratification.

END OF CANON
