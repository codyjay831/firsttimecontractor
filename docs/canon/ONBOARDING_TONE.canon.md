# ONBOARDING_TONE.canon.md
Version: 1.0  
Status: CANON — LOCKED  
Project: Firsttimecontractor  
Scope: Onboarding, First-Run UX, Empty States, Early Messaging

---

## 1. Purpose

Define the canonical tone and messaging rules for onboarding so that:
- users feel supported, not sold to
- expectations are clear and realistic
- the product builds trust immediately
- confusion and intimidation are minimized

---

## 2. Core Tone Principles (Non-Negotiable)

Onboarding tone MUST be:

- Calm
- Respectful
- Practical
- Honest
- Non-salesy

The user is assumed to be:
- capable
- learning
- serious about the trade

---

## 3. What Onboarding MUST Communicate

Early messaging must clearly communicate:

1. This is a **tool**, not a school  
2. You don’t need to “set everything up” to start  
3. You can explore safely without commitment  
4. Understanding matters more than speed  

---

## 4. Language Rules

### Required
- Plain language
- Short sentences
- Clear intent

### Forbidden
❌ Hype (“master”, “crush the exam”)  
❌ Urgency pressure (“don’t miss out”)  
❌ Infantilizing language  
❌ Shame or fear-based motivation  

---

## 5. First-Run Guidance Rule

On first use:
- show minimal guidance
- explain *why* a choice matters
- allow skipping without penalty

Example intent:
> “You can select a state later. Core concepts work everywhere.”

---

## 6. Canon Lock Statement

Any onboarding copy that:
- pressures users
- misrepresents scope
- implies guaranteed outcomes

is CANON-breaking.
