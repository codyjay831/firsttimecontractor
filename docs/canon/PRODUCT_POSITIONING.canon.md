# PRODUCT_POSITIONING.canon.md
Version: 1.0  
Status: CANON — LOCKED  
Project: Firsttimecontractor  
Scope: Public Positioning, Homepage Messaging, Scope Boundaries

---

## 1. Purpose

Define the canonical positioning of Firsttimecontractor so that:
- users immediately understand what the product is and is not
- the product does not misrepresent itself as formal education
- expectations are set correctly before signup or use
- messaging remains consistent as features evolve

This canon applies to:
- homepage
- “what we’re building” pages
- onboarding copy
- marketing and informational content

---

## 2. Core Positioning Statement (LOCKED)

> **Firsttimecontractor is not a contractor school.**  
> It is a practical tool designed to be used alongside education and after it — because real-world contracting requires interpretation, judgment, and repetition beyond test prep.

This statement is foundational and must not be contradicted.

---

## 3. What Firsttimecontractor IS (LOCKED)

Firsttimecontractor is:

- A practice and reference tool
- Exam-aligned, but not exam-only
- Focused on understanding rules, not memorizing answers
- Designed to explain how code and law are interpreted in practice
- Useful before, during, and long after formal education

---

## 4. What Firsttimecontractor IS NOT (LOCKED)

Firsttimecontractor is explicitly NOT:

- A licensed contractor school
- A replacement for required education
- A certification authority
- A guarantee of passing exams or obtaining licenses

This distinction must be clearly communicated wherever appropriate.

---

## 5. The Gap We Address

Formal contractor education primarily focuses on:
- preparing students to pass exams
- covering required material within time constraints

It often does not:
- explain how rules are interpreted on real jobs
- address common misunderstandings
- provide ongoing reference after schooling ends

Firsttimecontractor exists to bridge this gap by:
- connecting exam answers to real-world reasoning
- reinforcing understanding through practice and explanation
- remaining useful after certification, not just before it

---

## 6. Under-Construction Transparency (LOCKED)

### 6.1 Public Transparency Rule
When the product is incomplete or evolving:
- the site MUST clearly state that it is under active development
- this statement must be factual and calm
- no speculative timelines or promises are required

### 6.2 Tone Requirements
Under-construction messaging must be:
- transparent
- non-apologetic
- non-salesy

Example intent (not exact copy):
> “We’re building this in the open. You can explore what we’re working on and how it’s designed.”

---

## 7. Homepage Intent (LOCKED)

The homepage MUST prioritize:
1. Clarity over conversion
2. Trust over hype
3. Scope accuracy over feature lists

The homepage is NOT required to:
- list all features
- push immediate signup
- claim superiority over schools or competitors

---

## 8. Long-Term Consistency Rule

As features expand, the following must remain true:

- The product does not reposition itself as a school
- The product continues to emphasize understanding and interpretation
- Messaging remains aligned with supporting education, not replacing it

Any shift away from this requires explicit re-ratification.

---

## 9. Canon Lock Statement

This positioning is foundational.

Any change that:
- frames Firsttimecontractor as formal education
- implies certification authority
- promises guaranteed outcomes
- removes the “alongside and after education” framing

is CANON-breaking and requires explicit re-ratification.
