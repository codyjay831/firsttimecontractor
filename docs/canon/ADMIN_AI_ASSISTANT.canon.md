# ADMIN_AI_ASSISTANT.canon.md
Version: 1.0  
Status: CANON — LOCKED  
Project: Firsttimecontractor  
Scope: AI Use in Admin Review, Drafting, Verification Assistance

---

## 1. Purpose

Define how AI may assist admins without replacing human judgment or canon enforcement.

AI exists to:
- speed research
- summarize sources
- draft candidates
- suggest actions

AI does NOT decide truth.

---

## 2. Core Rule (Non-Negotiable)

> **AI may propose. Humans decide. Canon enforces.**

AI has zero publishing authority.

---

## 3. Allowed AI Capabilities

AI MAY:
- Draft new questions and explanations
- Compare content against updated statutes or bulletins
- Summarize official sources
- Highlight potential conflicts or ambiguities
- Recommend actions:
  - Clarify
  - Update
  - Retire
- Suggest confidence level changes

AI MAY NOT:
❌ Publish  
❌ Retire  
❌ Edit active content silently  
❌ Override state isolation rules  
❌ Bypass validation  

---

## 4. Input Constraints (Required)

Every AI request MUST include:
- Question content
- State (if Business/Law)
- Content confidence level
- Last reviewed / law year
- Relevant canon rules

AI output without context is forbidden.

---

## 5. Output Requirements

AI output MUST be labeled:
- “AI-assisted draft”
- “Requires human review”

AI output MUST:
- cite sources when possible
- flag uncertainty explicitly
- avoid legal disclaimers

---

## 6. Publishing Safeguards

- AI output always saves as **Draft**
- Publishing requires Publisher/Admin role
- Confirmation dialogs apply (per ADMIN_ACTIONS.canon.md)
- Audit log entry is required

---

## 7. Transparency (Admin-Only)

Admin UI MUST indicate when AI assisted:
> “This content was generated with AI assistance and requires review.”

---

## 8. Canon Lock Statement

Any change that:
- grants AI publishing authority,
- hides AI involvement from admins,
- or bypasses review/validation

is CANON-breaking and requires explicit re-ratification.

---

END OF CANON
