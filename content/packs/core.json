      "correctChoiceId": "b",
      "explanation": "When work performed (50%) exceeds billings (40%), the contractor has an asset called 'costs in excess of billings'. This represents earned revenue that hasn't been invoiced yet. Conversely, billing more than the work performed creates a liability.",

      "correctChoiceId": "b",
      "explanation": "Free float is the time a task can be delayed without affecting the next task; total float is the time it can be delayed without affecting the project completion.

      "correctChoiceId": "b",
      "explanation": "A claims-made policy only covers claims that are actually made and reported during the policy period.
