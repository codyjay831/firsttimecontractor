      "explanation": "While written change orders are strongly recommended, California courts recognize quantum meruit claims when work is performed at the owner's request and the owner accepts the benefit.

      "correctChoiceId": "a",
      "explanation": "Civil Code 8416 requires that a copy of the recorded lien must be served on the owner within 30 days of recording. Failure to serve the lien within this timeframe renders it void and unenforceable. This is a strict requirement with no exceptions for actual notice.",
